# Encryption-Decription

This is a prpgram I created a while ago that generates a random key, prompts the user to enter a message and then the program will encrypt using the ASCII char set. The decryption program asks for the matching key generated in the encryption program and asks for the encrypted message.

I intend to eventually make both parts run as one application by use of a menu.
